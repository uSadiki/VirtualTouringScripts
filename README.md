# VirtualTouringScripts

This repository contains the full set of C# scripts used in the Unity-based VR application developed as part of the master's thesis _"An Empirical Study of Remote Property Exploration in Virtual Reality Environments"_.

## Purpose

These scripts were written to support the core functionality of the VR application, including:

- **Menu management** for spawning and deleting furniture
- Handling the **Add Menu** and **Delete Menu**
- Managing **button behavior** and interactions
- Controlling **object selection, highlighting, and UI flow**
- Basic **user interaction logic** within the VR environment

The code is designed to work within Unity using the XR Interaction Toolkit and was developed for deployment on the Meta Quest platform.
