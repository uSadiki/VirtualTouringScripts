# VirtualTouringScripts

This repository contains selected C# scripts from the Unity-based VR application developed as part of the master’s thesis project _"An Empirical Study of Remote Property Exploration in Virtual Reality Environments"_.

The scripts were written for a virtual reality prototype built with Unity and deployed on the Meta Quest 3 headset. The goal of the application was to explore the potential of VR as a tool for remote interior evaluation and spatial decision-making.

## About the Code

These scripts cover core functionality such as:

- Object interaction and manipulation
- Furniture spawning and deletion
- Interaction design trade-offs (e.g., grab vs. gravity)
- Simplified UI control and user feedback collection

They reflect an iterative, development-focused approach to building an interactive VR environment within Unity.
